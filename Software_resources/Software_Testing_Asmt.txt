1. Drawbacks of Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)

Boundary Value Analysis focuses on testing values at the edges of input ranges. While useful, it has limitations:

Only works well for numeric ranges
BVA is not very effective for non-numeric inputs like strings, images, or complex data structures.

Misses internal defects
It tests boundary values but may ignore defects inside the valid range.

Assumes single-variable faults
BVA usually tests one variable at a time and may miss bugs caused by interactions between multiple inputs.

Not suitable for complex logic
Business rules or conditional logic cannot be fully tested using BVA alone.

Limited coverage
It does not guarantee complete test coverage, especially for combinations of inputs.



2.Test Cases for Date (DD/MM/YYYY)

Assumptions:

Date format: DD/MM/YYYY

Valid year range: 1900–2100

Test Case	Input Date	Expected Result
1	01/01/1900	Accepted
2	31/12/2100	Accepted
3	00/01/2024	Rejected
4	32/01/2024	Rejected
5	29/02/2024 (leap year)	Accepted
6	29/02/2023 (non-leap year)	Rejected
7	31/04/2024	Rejected
8	15/13/2024	Rejected
9	15/08/1899	Rejected
10	15/08/2101	Rejected

             └───┘

3. Robustness Testing

Robustness testing checks how the system behaves when invalid or unexpected inputs are given.
The goal is to ensure the application does not crash and provides proper error handling.

Example:
Entering -1 or 101 when the valid range is 1–100.

Worst Case Testing

Worst case testing checks the system using all possible combinations of boundary values for multiple inputs.
It helps identify defects caused by interaction between inputs.

Example:
If there are 3 inputs and each has 5 boundary values, total test cases = 5³ = 125.

Special Value Testing

Special value testing focuses on values that commonly cause failures in software systems.

Common special values:

0

NULL

Empty string

Maximum and minimum values

Special characters (@, #, %)

Example:
Entering an empty string in a mandatory password field.



3. Performance Test Case for a Mobile Application

Test Case: App Launch Performance

Field	Description
Test Case ID	PERF_MOB_01
Objective	Verify app launch time
Precondition	App installed on device
Test Steps	Launch the application
Test Data	N/A
Expected Result	App should launch within 3 seconds
Actual Result	As observed
Status	Pass / Fail

5.Random Testing is a software testing technique where test cases are generated randomly without following predefined test scenarios.

It is used to find unexpected defects by providing random inputs and performing random actions on the application.

Example:
Entering random numbers, text, and special characters in input fields of an application.
